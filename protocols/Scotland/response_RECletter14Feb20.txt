Recommendations

1. "It is the opinion of the Committee that it is always beneficial andreassuring for participants, to know that they can contact someone totalk to, who is not connected to the study should they wish to do so.At present there are no details provided of an Independent Person(someone who is independent from the study)."
==> included field for this in PIS/consent forms - to be populated.

2. "In Scotland, Children over the age of 12 who are deemed to havecapacity can consent on their own behalf, but the Committee notedthat there is a Signature line on the Assent form for under 12â€™s. TheCommittee would like to suggest that the researchers considerchanging this to a name line, for the child to write their name ratherthan have a signature line."
==> amended in 12to16_assent_2.0.docx
