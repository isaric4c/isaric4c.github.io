Selected hospital sites in the UK are established to recruit cases to ISARIC 4C. To set up your site, contact the study team at [CCP@liverpool.ac.uk](mailto:CCP@liverpool.ac.uk)

If you are set up and ready to go, please have a look at the [virtual site visit](/virtual_site_visit/). You can enter clinical case report form data at the [RedCap data entry site](https://ncov.medsci.ox.ac.uk).

These are the UK versions of the ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP). Click here for [global versions and harmonisation tools](https://isaric.net/ccp).
