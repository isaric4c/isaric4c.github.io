An invited foreword in the journal of Critical Care Medicine by Dr David Maslove and Prof Kenneth Baillie discussing the scientific achievements over the first year of the pandemic discusses the importance of the GenOMICC consortium. The ability of the study, which was in place well before the pandemic, to rapidly adapt to the changing situation is acknowledged as well as the open format of the trail, allowing other institutions and countries to get involved readily.
