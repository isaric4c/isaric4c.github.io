We proposed and established a Diagnostic Evaluation Platform at the University of Oxford (led by Dr Alex Mentzer) which is already being used to provide evidence to the UK government about the performance of new diagnostic and antibody tests. This work is essential because if tests work well they can save lives; if they don't, they can cause enormous damage.
