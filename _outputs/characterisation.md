# Quantifying the problem

Within weeks of being funded, we produced the largest study anywhere in the world of COVID-19 cases, enabling us to produce the most accurate risk prediction models for the UK population. These will continue to improve. The first one shows that obesity is an important risk factor amongst many. This finding will help to protect people at high risk of death from COVID-19. Our preprint is now online **Features of 16,749 hospitalised UK patients with COVID-19 using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol** See the final [peer-reviewed paper here](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1985). We have also produced an [interactive infographic](./risk) to help communicate these findings.
