# Co-Infection with influenza virus is associated with worse outcomes in hospitalised Covid patients

[Lancet 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00383-X)
[SAGE minutes](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1055478/S1517_Influenza_virus_coinfection_is_associated_with_worse_COVID-19_outcomes_COCIN.pdf)

This analysis provides a clear answer to a simple question: what is the effect of co-infection with common viruses on top of Covid? We compared outcomes across people who tested positive for three different viruses (influenza (flu) virus, adenovirus, and RSV) and found that co-infection with the flu virus was associated a higher chance of critical illness and death. 

This has direct implications for the NHS, suggesting that we should test patients more often for flu. It also provides another reason to vaccinate people more widely against both flu and Covid, particularly as flu is expected to make a comeback in 2022. 

As with much of our work, this was discussed immediately at the UK government advisory group, SAGE, and has already influenced the thinking around policy.

# Risk prediction: the 4C Mortality Score

[BMJ 9 Mar 2020](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3339)

Using data from 57, 824 hospital admissions, we developed and validated an easy-to-use risk stratification score based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. The 4C Mortality Score outperformed existing scores, showed utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 into different management groups. 

The 4C Mortality Score can be found here: [isaric4c.net/risk](/risk)

# Genetic mechanisms of severe Covid-19

[MedRxiv September 2020; Nature online December 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03065-y)

In collaboration with the [ISARIC GenOMICC study](https://genomicc.org) we discovered multiple genes that underlie critical illness in Covid-19, including several that led directly to potential therapeutic targets. 

In 2244 Covid cases, we compared severely ill patients with matched members of the population from three other studies (UK Biobank, Generation Scotland and 100,000 Genomes). We found genes involved in two molecular processes - antiviral immunity and lung inflammation - were important in determining the development of severe Covid-19.  We replicated our findings in additional studies (Covid-19 HGI and 23andme). The associations with disease are robustly confirmed in these studies.

Although we know the DNA associations are real, we can't always be sure exactly how these variants lead to disease. The most likely genes underlying each of the four new discoveries are IFNAR2, TYK2, OAS1, DPP9.

The action of some genetic variants is similar the the action of drugs - either increasing or decreasing the amount of a particular molecule or signal. We can use this to predict new treatments. This evidence has already influenced the inclusion of new therapies in the RECOVERY trial.

# Characterisation of in-hospital complications associated with COVID-19

[The Lancet, 17 July 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00799-6)

As well as death, severe COVID-19 disease has effects on many different organ systems. In this study, published in The Lancet, we characterised the burden of complications and organ injury in 73,197 patients admitted to hospital between January and August 2020. We found that nearly 1 in 2 people had at least one complication. Having a complication was associated with higher rates of critical care admission and mortality. When we studied predictors of complications, we identified that unlike in the case of mortality, where older, more frail people had a higher chance of death, younger people were also at risk of developing complications. This study received international media attention and coverage from the BBC, ABC, Sky news, ITV, STV and most major UK newspapers.

This work was also the subject of a system-wide [NIHR update](https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/one-in-two-people-hospitalised-with-covid-19-develop-complications-may-need-support/).

# Circulating histones play a central role in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and mortality

[Haematologica Early View 8 April 2021](https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2021.278492)

COVID-19 has highlighted the lethal consequences of immunothrombosis; i.e. the cross-talk between coagulation, inflammation and the innate immune system. These patients have
significant immune cell death, which can release pro-coagulant and cytotoxic histones. In this translational study, we showed that circulating histones play a central role in critically ill COVID-19 patients with admission histone levels significantly elevated with increasing severity of COVID-19 infection.

# Tissue proteomic analysis identifies mechanisms and stages of immunopathology in fatal COVID-19

[American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology 26 October 2021](https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2021-0358OC)

Peripheral blood inflammatory profiles are increasingly well characterised in Covid-19 but knowledge of the host response within inflamed tissues is lacking. Post-mortem lung and spleen whole-tissue proteomics identified differentially abundant proteins of mechanistic and translational interest (including MCP-3, TYMP, EN-RAGE and CSF-1). Lung proteomic clusters identified distinct disease stages that differed in pulmonary viral presence, inflammation severity, illness duration, and abundance of proteins of interest including IL-6 and IRAK1

# Hospital acquired COVID-19 in England during the first wave of the pandemic

[BMC Infectious Diseases June 2022](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-022-07490-4)

Using data from the ISARIC4C UK COVID-19 Clinical Information Network study, this study identified that 1 in 5 hospitalised patients in England during the first wave of the pandemic caught the virus while hospitalised for other causes. However, this accounted for less than 1% of all COVID-19 cases in England, both hospitalised and not.

It is emerging that long-term symptoms are often present in people who
have had acute Covid-19 disease. We found that over half of patients
reported not feeling fully recovered several months after onset of
Covid-19 symptoms. The symptoms reported include fatigue, followed by
breathlessness. These findings were present in young, previously healthy
working age adults, and were most common in younger females.

# Treating COVID-19 patients with dexamethasone and remdesivir prevents neurological complications

[Annals of Neurology October 2022](https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.26536)

Preventing the development of neurological complications after severe COVID-19 infections remains an important aim for doctors. Data from the ISARIC4C study group showed that individuals who go on to have neurological issues after being hospitalised with COVID-19 do not recover as well and have an increased risk of death. This study showed that patients treated with dexamethasone, a commonly used steroid, or remdesivir, an antiviral drug first used in hepatitis C, were less likely to have neurological issues than those who were not treated. The use of both of these drugs together further reduced the risk of complications.

Data from paediatric patients in the ISARIC4C study were used to help inform SAGE for the vaccination policy in children and young people earlier in 2022. Even though there was a change in the viral variant, a relaxation of shielding, and a return to face-to-face schooling, no evidence of increased severity in paediatric COVID-19 hospital admissions was found between the second and first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was present in the majority of hospitalised patients with Covid-19 (ISARIC4C study) and influenza A (MOSAIC study, 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic), correlated with severity and persisted in non-selected critical illness survivors (prior to Covid-19 pandemic) at concentrations expected to disrupt bone metabolism. These findings support early supplementation trials to determine if insufficiency is causal in progression to severe disease, and investigation of longer-term bone health outcomes.

# Using a double binding antigen assay to detect and measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

[Journal of Virological Methods, April 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.114475)

Accurate and sensitive detection of antibody to SARS-CoV-2 remains an essential component of the pandemic response. 
Measuring antibody that predicts neutralising activity and the vaccine response is an absolute requirement for laboratory-based confirmatory and reference activity.
The viral receptor binding domain (RBD) constitutes the prime target antigen for neutralising antibody. A hybrid double antigen binding assay (DABA) for anti-RBD showed a specificity of 100 % on 825 pre COVID-19 samples and a potential sensitivity of 99.6 % on 276 recovery samples, predicting quantitatively the presence of neutralising antibody determined by pseudo-type neutralization and by plaque reduction.

# Detecting SARS-CoV-2 by non-invasive means

[Journal of Infection August 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.05.033)

Finding non-invasive methods to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been essential for rapid self-testing during the pandemic. This study compared gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), taken by swabbing the gums, to blood samples from patients in the ISARIC4C UK study. It was shown that GCF taken from the gums can detect the virus, and higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the GCF in the early acute phase of the illness are linked to more severe COVID-19 infections.

The Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread rapidly, even in those who had been vaccinated against it. This study examined the different DNA sequence of this viral variant to determine mutations in the virus from patient blood samples from the ISARIC4C study and the effect these mutations have on the ability for the vaccination to prevent infection or illness. Understanding these alterations can help with future vaccine strategies and prevent more rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants in the future.

The ISARIC-CCP UK study has aided in the creation of the 2022 World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for the use of chest imaging in COVID-19. These guidelines state that “for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, not currently hospitalized but with mild symptoms, WHO suggests using chest imaging to in addition to clinical and laboratory assessment to decide on hospital admission versus home discharge”. This guideline is based on patients first undergoing the validated risk stratification tool outlined in ISARIC-CCP.

# Distinct clinical symptom patterns in patients hospitalised with COVID-19

[Scientific reports April 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08032-3)

Although the most common symptoms of COVID-19 tend to be fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, many other symptoms have been reported, including fatigue, confusion, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Using the data from 59,011 patients in the ISARI4C study. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. On the other hand, patients presenting with confusion were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. This study suggests four different groups of patients with differing symptoms, with or without the core three symptoms, that should be treated differently if hospitalised to prevent mortality.

# Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and outcomes of COVID-19

[The Lancet: Rheumatology May 07, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2665-9913(21)00104-1)

Early in the pandemic it was suggested that pre-existing use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could lead to increased disease severity in patients with COVID-19. NSAIDs are an important analgesic, particularly in those with rheumatological disease, and are widely available to the general public without prescription.

Using data from 78,674 patients in ISARIC4C, we showed that NSAID use is not associated with higher mortality or increased severity of COVID-19. To our knowledge, our prospective study includes the largest number of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 to date, and adds to the literature on the safety of NSAIDs and in-hospital outcomes. NSAIDs do not appear to increase the risk of worse in-hospital outcomes. NSAIDs are an important analgesic modality and have a vital opioid-sparing role in pain management. Patients and clinicians should be reassured by these findings that NSAIDs are safe in the context of the pandemic.

# Role of blood cytokines IL-6 and GM-CSF in severe COVID-19

[Science Immunology 10 Mar 2021](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abg9873)

We have identified new biomarkers of inflammation that both reveal the
severity of COVID-19 and set it apart from severe influenza. Many
inflammatory cytokines were found in greater numbers in severe COVID-19
and that these levels generally indicate severe disease. We identified
patterns within the data that were the most clearly linked to severe
cases of COVID-19; two cytokines in particular, IL-6 (interleukin 6) and
GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) play central
roles. With more research, we can see if GM-CSF could be used as a
marker in early disease to identify those at risk of going on to develop
more severe symptoms.

# Viral RNA found in blood is not infectious

[Wellcome Open Research 29 Jul 2020](https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16002.1)

Laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection uses PCR to detect viral
RNA (vRNA) in respiratory samples. While SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been
detected in other sample types, there is very little understanding about
its clinical or laboratory significance. This has implications for
testing and for safe working in a laboratory setting. To answer this, we
undertook a systematic review for evidence of viral RNA in blood. We
also attempted viral isolation from PCR-positive blood samples. Viral
RNA was detectable at very low levels, but this was not associated with
infectious SARS-CoV-2. This work will help to inform biosafety
precautions for handling blood from COVID-19 patients.

# Using imaging in COVID-19 -- UK National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database

[European Respiratory Journal 13 Aug 2020](http://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01809-2020)

The National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database (NCCID) is a repository of
chest radiographs, CT and MRI images and clinical data from COVID-19
patients across the UK, to support research and development of AI
technology and give insight into COVID-19 disease. To maximise efficient
resource utilisation in busy hospitals during the course of the
pandemic, NCCID are linking imaging data to the ISARIC4C dataset, and
aim to link to the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre
(ICNARC). ISARIC investigators are collating clinical information and
biological samples for COVID-19 cases of all ages admitted to hospitals,
while ICNARC collates detailed data from adults in the intensive care
setting. The study has also been supported by Health Data Research UK as
part of its UK response to COVID-19.

# Outcomes of hospitalised COVID-19 patients with interstitial lung disease

[American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care 15 Dec 2020](https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202007-2794oc)

We completed an international multicentre audit of patients with prior
diagnosis of Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD) admitted to hospital with
COVID-19. We showed that these patients are at increased risk of death,
particularly those with poor lung function and obesity. Data from this
study showed that patients with ILD should follow self-isolation
guidelines for vulnerable individuals and be prioritised for
vaccinations.

# Co-Infections, Secondary Infections, and Antimicrobial Usage

[Lancet Microbe 2 June 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00090-2)

We investigated the frequency and microbiological details of bacterial co-infection and secondary infection, in addition to antimicrobial usage in 48,902 patients hsopitalised with COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave. We found that Covid-19 related respiratory or bloodstream bacterial infection was rare (n=1,107); the majority (71%) were secondary infection, acquired >48 hours after admission. However, antimicrobial use is high with 37% prescribed pre-hospital antimicrobials, while 85% received one or more antimicrobials during their hospital stay.
 
Based on our data, we recommend a range of existing antimicrobial stewardship interventions that should be prioritised for incorporation into COVID-19 patient care to mitigate worsening of antimicrobial resistance. As well as restricting prescribing without a confirmed diagnosis, these include tailoring the choice of antimicrobials (when required) to likely pathogens and local resistance patterns, and encouraging clinicians to discontinue antimicrobials if co-infection is deemed unlikely and tests confirm that patients do not have a bacterial infection.

# Testing the tests

[MedRxiv May 2020](https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15927.1)

We proposed and established a Diagnostic Evaluation Platform at the University of Oxford (led by Dr Alex Mentzer) which is already being used to provide evidence to the UK government about the performance of new diagnostic and antibody tests. This work is essential because if tests work well they can save lives; if they don't, they can cause enormous damage.

<!--<https://lctc.org.uk/research/ccp-cancer-uk/>-->

The ISARIC4C investigators collaborated with Prof Carlo Palmieri and
team to characterise the first 1,797 hospitalised patients with cancer
and COVID-19. From here a new study was launched to assess the impact of
COVID-19 on people with cancer: The Clinical Characterisation Protocol
(CCP) CANCER-UK. The project will run over 12 months and will examine
questions that are important for the care of patients with cancer. With
almost 7,000 patients with both confirmed cancer and COVID-19 diagnoses
already enrolled, it will be one of the largest and most detailed
studies in the world.

The study has received funding from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)
and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), with additional
funding from The Clatterbridge Cancer Charity.

# Symptom clusters

[MedRxiv August 16th 2020.](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.14.20168088)

![Different outcomes among patients presenting with different patterns of symptoms](/Users/jkb/Dropbox/6_websites/isaric4c.github.io/img/figures/store/symptom_clusters_outcome.png)

Because of the large scale of the ISARIC-4C study, we were able to detect robust groupings of patients with different patterns of symptoms. We found four patterns that are strikingly differnet from the core symptom groups: gastro-intestinal disease, productive cough, confusion, and pauci-symptomatic presentations. Each of these has a different clinical course and a different chance of death.

These observations deepen our understanding of COVID-19 and will influence clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and future mechanistic and clinical studies.

# New immune biomarkers for COVID-19

[Immunology September 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13585)

This study looked at a specific immune process in the body, known as the complement system. This mechanism allows microbes and damaged cells to be removed from the body, attacks pathogens, and promotes inflammation. This system is more active in patients with COVID-19 and blocking the system has been considered as a potential treatment. Blood samples from 682 hospitalised patients, including those from the ISARIC4C study, were compared to healthy individuals and multiple components of the complement system were shown to be altered. The levels of some of these markers, known as Ba, iC3b, and properdin, were shown to be associated with disease severity and death. Identifying these new biomarkers helps us to understand how the body responds to COVID-19 and allows new targets for treatment strategies.

# Vulnerability of Down's syndrome (DS) patients to severe COVID-19

[EClinical Medicine 22 Feb 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100769))

Providing data and support to the Trisomy 21 Society, a study was
conducted to determine if health conditions, immune dysfunction, and
premature aging associated with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome, DS) may
impact the clinical course of COVID-19. Whilst signs/symptoms of
COVID-19 and risk factors for severe disease course are similar to the
general population, individuals with DS present significantly higher
rates of medical complications and mortality, especially from age 40.
