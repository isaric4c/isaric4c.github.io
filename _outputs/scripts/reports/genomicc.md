# Whole-genome sequencing reveals host factors underlying critical COVID-19

[Nature July 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04576-6)


This research article outlines key findings from the GenOMICC study, using whole-genome sequencing in **7,491 critically ill individuals compared with 48,400 controls to** **discover and replicate 23 independent variants** that significantly predispose patients to critical COVID-19. This included novel 16 variants which were yet to be identified. The multiple variants found in this study tended to be involved in the two mechanisms which have been proposed as the major drivers of severe disease: failure to control viral replication; or an enhanced tendency towards pulmonary inflammation and intravascular coagulation. This article determines the use of the GenOMMIC study in comparing cases of critical illness against population controls in the highly efficient detection of therapeutically relevant mechanisms of disease.

# Two key takeaways from a year of pandemic research

[Critical Care Medicine August 2021](10.1097/CCM.0000000000005078)


An invited foreword in the journal of Critical Care Medicine by Dr David Maslove and Prof Kenneth Baillie discussing the scientific achievements over the first year of the pandemic discusses the importance of the GenOMICC consortium. The ability of the study, which was in place well before the pandemic, to rapidly adapt to the changing situation is acknowledged as well as the open format of the trail, allowing other institutions and countries to get involved readily.

# Neandertal DNA associated with severe illness with COVID-19

[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America March 2021](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2026309118)


Data from the GenOMICC consortium was used to identify a **genetic variation on chromosome 12 which protects against severe disease** when infected with SARS-CoV-2. This inherited genetic factor has been shown to originate in Neandertals and has been shown to be found in humans all over the world. Previously, Neandertal DNA alterations have been shown to increase the risk of severe disease in COVID-19 but this protective variation can help in our understanding of the virus and disease.

# Identification of a novel protective genetic variant against severe COVID-19

[Current Research in Translational Medicine May 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.retram.2022.103333)


Researchers investigated the human protein transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) in COVID-19 due to the knowledge that it is required to activate the virus' spike protein and facilitates entry for the virus into target cells. Using the GenOMICC consortium data from critically ill patients, a **common variant in this protein was shown to reduce the likelihood of developing severe COVID-19**. There are already approved drugs to target TMPRSS2, which are currently used for pancreatitis and esophagitis, which could be used in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.

# Rare genetic variants influencing COVID-19 outcomes

[PLoS Genetics November 2022](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010367)


The GenOMICC cohort was used to aid in the confirmation of results found in other genome-wide association studies into rare variants which were expected to have the largest impact on COVID-19 outcomes. This study aimed to determine these rare variants to provide additional insights into disease susceptibility and pathogenesis, allowing for the determination of future therapeutic targets. The sharing of data during the pandemic has been key for advancements in the understanding and treatment of COVID-19.

# Biomarkers of COVID-19 and technologies to combat SARS-CoV-2

[Advances in Biomarker Sciences and Technology August 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abst.2020.08.001)


The GenOMICC study was acknowledged as an important innovative approach for drug target determination in a review article discussing the ways in which biomarkers and technologies are being utilised in the COVID-19 pandemic.

# The ACE2 coronavirus receptor

[Circulation May 2022](https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.057888)


It has been discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters human cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). GenOMICC consortium data on severe COVID-19 cases was used in this study to show specific variations in ACE2. The researchers also showed that elevated ACE2 levels show a causal relationship with COVID-19 severity, hospitalization, and infection. This suggests that blocking ACE2 pharmacologically may be promising in the treatment of COVID-19 or its comorbidities.
