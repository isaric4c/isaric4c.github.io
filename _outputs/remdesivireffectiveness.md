Adults with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir were compared with propensity-score matched control, identified from the ISARIC-CCP UK study. Remdesivir patients were matched to controls according to baseline underlying 14-day mortality risk. Remdesivir did not significantly improve mortality in this study.
