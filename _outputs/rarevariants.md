The GenOMICC cohort was used to aid in the confirmation of results found in other genome-wide association studies into rare variants which were expected to have the largest impact on COVID-19 outcomes. This study aimed to determine these rare variants to provide additional insights into disease susceptibility and pathogenesis, allowing for the determination of future therapeutic targets. The sharing of data during the pandemic has been key for advancements in the understanding and treatment of COVID-19.
