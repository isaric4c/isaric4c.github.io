[WHO Guidelines 2022]({{page.doi}})

The ISARIC-CCP UK study has aided in the creation of the 2022 World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for the use of chest imaging in COVID-19. These guidelines state that “for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, not currently hospitalized but with mild symptoms, WHO suggests using chest imaging to in addition to clinical and laboratory assessment to decide on hospital admission versus home discharge”. This guideline is based on patients first undergoing the validated risk stratification tool outlined in ISARIC-CCP.
