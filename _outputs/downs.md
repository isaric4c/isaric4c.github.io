Providing data and support to the Trisomy 21 Society, a study was
conducted to determine if health conditions, immune dysfunction, and
premature aging associated with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome, DS) may
impact the clinical course of COVID-19. Whilst signs/symptoms of
COVID-19 and risk factors for severe disease course are similar to the
general population, individuals with DS present significantly higher
rates of medical complications and mortality, especially from age 40.
