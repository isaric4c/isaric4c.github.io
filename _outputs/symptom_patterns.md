Although the most common symptoms of COVID-19 tend to be fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, many other symptoms have been reported, including fatigue, confusion, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Using the data from 59,011 patients in the ISARI4C study. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. On the other hand, patients presenting with confusion were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. This study suggests four different groups of patients with differing symptoms, with or without the core three symptoms, that should be treated differently if hospitalised to prevent mortality.
