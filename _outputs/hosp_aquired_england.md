Using data from the ISARIC4C UK COVID-19 Clinical Information Network study, this study identified that 1 in 5 hospitalised patients in England during the first wave of the pandemic caught the virus while hospitalised for other causes. However, this accounted for less than 1% of all COVID-19 cases in England, both hospitalised and not.
