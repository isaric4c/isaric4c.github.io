ISARIC4C and CO-CIN (Tier 0) feed data dynamically to Public Health
Scotland, Public Health England, SPI-M, NERVTAG and SAGE. SPI-M have
been highly productive and published several analysis that informed
Policy.

ISARIC4C and CO-CIN data are used to inform the NHS England Independent Advisory Group concerning the use of neutralising monoclonal antibodies and anti-viral drugs in high-risk clinical subgroups.
