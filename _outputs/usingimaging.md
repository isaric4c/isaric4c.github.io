The National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database (NCCID) is a repository of
chest radiographs, CT and MRI images and clinical data from COVID-19
patients across the UK, to support research and development of AI
technology and give insight into COVID-19 disease. To maximise efficient
resource utilisation in busy hospitals during the course of the
pandemic, NCCID are linking imaging data to the ISARIC4C dataset, and
aim to link to the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre
(ICNARC). ISARIC investigators are collating clinical information and
biological samples for COVID-19 cases of all ages admitted to hospitals,
while ICNARC collates detailed data from adults in the intensive care
setting. The study has also been supported by Health Data Research UK as
part of its UK response to COVID-19.
