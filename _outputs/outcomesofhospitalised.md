We completed an international multicentre audit of patients with prior
diagnosis of Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD) admitted to hospital with
COVID-19. We showed that these patients are at increased risk of death,
particularly those with poor lung function and obesity. Data from this
study showed that patients with ILD should follow self-isolation
guidelines for vulnerable individuals and be prioritised for
vaccinations.
