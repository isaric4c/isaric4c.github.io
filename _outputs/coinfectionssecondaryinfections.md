Using microbiological investigations recorded for 8649 hospitalised
COVID-19 patients, we found that microbiologically-confirmed
bacterial/fungal infections is rare, and more likely to be secondary
infections. Gram-negative organisms and S. aureus are the predominant
pathogens. The frequency and nature of antimicrobial usage is
concerning, but tractable targets for stewardship interventions exist.
