# Setting the standard

ISARIC 4C defined the international reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 serology by providing the first samples to the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) from COVID-19 cases. These were used to make the WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 serology, which will be used all over the world to compare results from blood tests for COVID-19. 7 of the 11 patients who contributed to the standard were recruited by ISARIC 4C.
