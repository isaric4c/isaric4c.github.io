Data from paediatric patients in the ISARIC4C study were used to help inform SAGE for the vaccination policy in children and young people earlier in 2022. Even though there was a change in the viral variant, a relaxation of shielding, and a return to face-to-face schooling, no evidence of increased severity in paediatric COVID-19 hospital admissions was found between the second and first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.
