ISARIC4C was designed from the outset as a foundation for the UK outbreak response, supporting researchers across the country.

The 4C consortium has:

-  Responded to clinical 120 data requests, providing data to 100 collaborators
-  Shipped out a total of 21,000 samples from our hub labs in Liverpool and Glasgow
-  Provided sample sets to 21 different institutions (Universities, Public Health England, NIBSC, Francis Crick Inst., NIH)

Dynamic data feeds from the [data analysis platform](/ap) are provided via API to Public Health in England & Scotland & SPI-M with independent reports prepared by them for NERVTAG and SAGE.
