It has been discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters human cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). GenOMICC consortium data on severe COVID-19 cases was used in this study to show specific variations in ACE2. The researchers also showed that elevated ACE2 levels show a causal relationship with COVID-19 severity, hospitalization, and infection. This suggests that blocking ACE2 pharmacologically may be promising in the treatment of COVID-19 or its comorbidities.
