It is emerging that long-term symptoms are often present in people who
have had acute Covid-19 disease. We found that over half of patients
reported not feeling fully recovered several months after onset of
Covid-19 symptoms. The symptoms reported include fatigue, followed by
breathlessness. These findings were present in young, previously healthy
working age adults, and were most common in younger females.
