At the start of the pandemic, ISARIC4C was able to provide convalescent
samples of PCR-positive hospitalised patients with COVID-19 to
characterise the immunological properties of COVID-19. This was
essential to the development of the viral vectored coronavirus vaccine
developed by the Oxford COVID Vaccine Trial Group.
