Preventing the development of neurological complications after severe COVID-19 infections remains an important aim for doctors. Data from the ISARIC4C study group showed that individuals who go on to have neurological issues after being hospitalised with COVID-19 do not recover as well and have an increased risk of death. This study showed that patients treated with dexamethasone, a commonly used steroid, or remdesivir, an antiviral drug first used in hepatitis C, were less likely to have neurological issues than those who were not treated. The use of both of these drugs together further reduced the risk of complications.
