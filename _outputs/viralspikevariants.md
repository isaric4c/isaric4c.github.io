We showed that the N439K viral mutation has enhanced binding affinity to
the ACE2 receptor and that this variant cause infections with similar
clinical outcomes compared to the wild type. This mutation is resistant
against neutralising monoclonal antibodies and from polyclonal sera from
persons recovered from infection. Our findings have highlighted how this
virus can mutate and the need for ongoing molecular surveillance to
guide development and usage of vaccines and therapeutics.
