Sequencing the viral genome as the outbreak progresses is important,
particularly the identification of new variants and to identify whether
any changes in the genome will impair clinical testing. Using the
MinION/GridIONS platform, we developed a sensitive protocol to rapidly
sequence the viral genome. With this study, we showed that
amplicon-based detection and subsequent sequencing are feasible for
identifying the SARS-CoV-2 genome or nucleic acid in samples from
patients with COVID-19.
