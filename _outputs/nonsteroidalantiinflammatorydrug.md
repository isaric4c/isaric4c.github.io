Early in the pandemic it was suggested that pre-existing use of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could lead to increased
disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Analysing data from 78 674
COVID-19 patients, we found that NSAID use is not associated with higher
mortality or increased severity of COVID-19 severity. Policy makers
should consider reviewing issued advice around NSAID prescribing and
COVID-19 severity.
