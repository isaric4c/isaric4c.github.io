The ISARIC4C investigators collaborated with Prof Carlo Palmieri and
team to characterise the first 1,797 hospitalised patients with cancer
and COVID-19. From here a new study was launched to assess the impact of
COVID-19 on people with cancer: The Clinical Characterisation Protocol
(CCP) CANCER-UK. The project will run over 12 months and will examine
questions that are important for the care of patients with cancer. With
almost 7,000 patients with both confirmed cancer and COVID-19 diagnoses
already enrolled, it will be one of the largest and most detailed
studies in the world.

The study has received funding from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)
and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), with additional
funding from The Clatterbridge Cancer Charity.
