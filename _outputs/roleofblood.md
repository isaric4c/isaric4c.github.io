We have identified new biomarkers of inflammation that both reveal the
severity of COVID-19 and set it apart from severe influenza. Many
inflammatory cytokines were found in greater numbers in severe COVID-19
and that these levels generally indicate severe disease. We identified
patterns within the data that were the most clearly linked to severe
cases of COVID-19; two cytokines in particular, IL-6 (interleukin 6) and
GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) play central
roles. With more research, we can see if GM-CSF could be used as a
marker in early disease to identify those at risk of going on to develop
more severe symptoms.
