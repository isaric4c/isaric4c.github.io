We have explored the mechanisms of viral transmission. Our findings of
extensive viral RNA contamination of surfaces and air across a range of
acute healthcare settings in the absence of cultured virus highlighted
the potential risk from surface and air contamination in managing
COVID-19, and the need for effective use of PPE, social distancing, and
hand/surface hygiene.
