# Outputs from the ISARIC4C consortium

We will keep this page updated with research results, reports and outher achievements form ISARIC4C.

During its first 3 months, the ISARIC4C consortium expanded from the initial 34 co-investigators to more than 150 active contributors, and provides a data and sampling infrastructure for follow-up of COVID cases in the P-HOSP consortium.

As well as these outputs, see the [dynamic report of age, sex, and 28 day status](../reports) of patients admitted with COVID.
