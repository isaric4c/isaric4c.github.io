# CCP activation for unexplained hepatitis

<!--

## Inclusion criteria

Confirmed or *suspected* cases are eligible for inclusion. 

## Case definition

The following definition currently defines *confirmed* cases: 

- Patient 10 years old or younger
- AST or ALT > 500 iu/L
- Not diagnosed with hepatitis A to E or poisoning

## Suspected cases

Please recruit cases over a broader age range, or earlier in disease, if there is clincal suspicion that they might have unexplained hepatitis. In particular, patients up to 16years old, with rising AST/ALT above 300iu/L, would count as suspected cases.

With consent, enrol all cases as per Tier 0, AND where there is site capacity, sample for Tier 1 or Tier 2 according to the protocol schedule

-->

## Inclusion criteria

Elevated liver transaminases in child <16yrs, and not due to other diagnoses such as hepatitis viruses A-E, autoimmune hepatitis, or poisoning. Elevated transaminases defined as ALT >400 iU/L and/or AST >400 iU/L. These criteria may be refined as knowledge is gained.

These criteria are deliberately broader than the public health case definition.

With consent, enrol all cases as per Tier 0, AND where there is site capacity, sample for Tier 1 or Tier 2 according to the protocol schedule.

## Case report form
