### Urgent UK-wide research in COVID-19

Research staff are needed to support the following urgent priority public health research activities relating to COVID-19. The following studies are funded and co-enrolling together across the whole UK to answer key clinical questions during the outbreak.

#### ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Protocol (CCP) Tier 0 (CO-CIN) *Data collection, no consent*

**CO**VID19 **C**linical **I**nformation **N**etwork (DHSC-funded). Near real-time analysis and reporting of the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to inform the research and public health responses. To achieve this we need clincal research nurses and administrators to gather data from clinical notes and enter it into a simple online database.

#### ISARIC CCP Tiers 1/2 (4C)  *Sample collection, consent needed*

**C**OVID19 **C**linical **C**haracterisation **C**onsortium (MRC-funded). Obtaining research samples. Either one sample set at recruitment, or 4 sample sets on Day 1, 3, and 9 and (if possible) another set 28 days after discharge. Aims to understand transmission, pathogenesis, and prognosis. To achieve this we need PPE-trained research nurses to obtain consent, and samples of pathogen shedding sites and blood.

#### RECOVERY TRIAL *Adaptive platform trial, consent needed*

**R**andomised **E**valuation of **COV**ID-19 Th*er*ap*y* (MRC/DHSC-funded). Trial of widely available, high-priority interventions, among confirmed COVID19 cases requiring hospital admission, to determine effect on death or requirement for invasive ventilation. Interventions will be added and removed over time as needed. Given the unprecedented impact COVID 19 will have on the health of the population, even small clinical benefits may be of significant benefit. Designed to give individual patients the best chance of getting an effective therapy. To do this we need GCP-trained research nurses to support front-line clinical staff recruiting patients.

#### GenOMICC *Genetic study, consent needed*

**Gen**etics **O**f **Mortality** **I**n **C**ritical **C**are (Wellcome-funded). UK-wide ICU study to identify variants underlying genetic susceptibility to critical illness with coronavirus, which may help identify new targets for treatment and mechanisms of disease.

These research activities require a substantial input from trained research nurses - particularly research nurses with PPE training, and experience in recruiting to clinical trials in emergency medicine

Research nurses should also be screening, consenting, randomising (after clinician confirms eligibility and documents which of the arms are suitable per patient, prescribes randomised drug), dispensing of drug to patient, data collection, data entry, follow up (each day to ensure drugs taken), Check AE/SAEs. Training and education of clinical staff, ensuring GCP completed by all clinicians involved, supporting, encourage, motivating.
