    -   research or development activity aligned to the key research
        priorities set by UKRI and WHO;
    -   delivery of results within the timeframe of the outbreak;
    -   for commercial product development, rapid upscaling and
        deployment of usable products to market (e.g.Â CE marking,
        regulatory approvals in place)

## Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

abide by the decisions of the committee.
