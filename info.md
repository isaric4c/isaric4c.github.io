# The ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (4C) study

This page is intended to provide updates for participants on the work that has been done with their samples and data. We will keep this page updated with research results, reports and plans.

## Key achievements

- **Understanding the impact of ethnicity** We have carefully studied the effect of ethnicity on outcomes in hospitalised patients. The pre-print is here: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3618215](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3618215)

- **Predicting risk** We have produced the largest study anywhere in the world of COVID-19 cases (25,000 cases so far), enabling us to produce the most accurate risk prediction models for the UK population. These will continue to improve. The first one shows that obesity is an important risk factor amongst many. This finding will help to protect people at high risk of death from COVID-19. Our preprint is now online **Features of 16,749 hospitalised UK patients with COVID-19 using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol** See the [pre-print here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.23.20076042v1), and the final [peer-reviewed paper here](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1985). We have also produced an [interactive infographic](./risk) to help communicate these findings.

- **Testing the tests** We proposed and established a Diagnostic Evaluation Platform at the University of Oxford (led by Dr Alex Mentzer) which is already being used to provide evidence to the UK government about the performance of new diagnostic and antibody tests. This work is essential because if tests work well they can save lives; if they don't, they can cause enormous damage.

- **Defining the international reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 serology** ISARIC 4C provided the first samples to the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) from COVID-19 cases. These were used to make the WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 serology, which will be used all over the world to compare results from blood tests for COVID-19. 7 of the 11 patients who contributed to the standard were recruited by ISARIC 4C.
