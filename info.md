# The ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (4C) study

This page is intended to provide updates for participants on the work that has been done with their samples and data. We will keep this page updated with research results, reports and plans.

## Key achievements

- **Predicting risk** We have produced the largest study anywhere in the world of COVID-19 cases (25,000 cases so far), enabling us to produce the most accurate risk prediction models for the UK population. These will continue to improve. The first one shows that obesity is an important risk factor amongst many. This finding will help to protect people at high risk of death from COVID-19. Our preprint is now online **Features of 16,749 hospitalised UK patients with COVID-19 using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol** See the [pre-print here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.23.20076042v1), and the final [peer-reviewed paper here](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1985). We have also produced an [interactive infographic](./risk) to help communicate these findings.

- **Testing the tests** We proposed and established a Diagnostic Evaluation Platform at the University of Oxford (led by Dr Alex Mentzer) which is already being used to provide evidence to the UK government about the performance of new diagnostic and antibody tests. This work is essential because if tests work well they can save lives; if they don't, they can cause enormous damage.

- **Defining the international reference standard for COVID-19 serology** ISARIC 4C provided the first 11 samples to the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) from COVID-19 cases. These samples will be used to make an international standard, which will be used all over the world to compare results from blood tests for COVID-19.

## Recruitment

We have recruited:
- 650 patients at Tier 2 (serial sampling)
- 173 at Tier 1 (single sample)
- 40,303 at Tier Zero (case report forms - source data for the COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN))
- Critically-ill patients can also be recruited to a sister study, the [ISARIC GenOMICC study](https://genomicc.org)
