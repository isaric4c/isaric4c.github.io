This study by Yanchung Peng, Alex Mentzer, Tao Dong and colleagues reveals that the immune system responds to many different parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This will influence vaccine design, which often focuses only on the most prominent parts of the virus. It also reveals key differences in the way immune cells fight the virus in patients who have mild disease, helping us to better understand how some people are able to fight it off without becoming very sick.
