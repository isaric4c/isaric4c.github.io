 abstract = {Objective To characterise the clinical features of patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United Kingdom during the growth phase of the first wave of this outbreak who were enrolled in the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study, and to explore risk factors associated with mortality in hospital. Design Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. Setting 208 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 6 February and 19 April 2020. A case report form developed by ISARIC and WHO was used to collect clinical data. A minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 3 May 2020) allowed most patients to complete their hospital admission. Participants 20 133 hospital inpatients with covid-19. Main outcome measures Admission to critical care (high dependency unit or intensive care unit) and mortality in hospital. Results The median age of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, or with a diagnosis of covid-19 made in hospital, was 73 years (interquartile range 58-82, range 0-104). More men were admitted than women (men 60\%, n=12 068; women 40\%, n=8065). The median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days (interquartile range 1-8). The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (31\%, 5469/17 702), uncomplicated diabetes (21\%, 3650/17 599), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (18\%, 3128/17 634), and chronic kidney disease (16\%, 2830/17 506); 23\% (4161/18 525) had no reported major comorbidity. Overall, 41\% (8199/20 133) of patients were discharged alive, 26\% (5165/20 133) died, and 34\% (6769/20 133) continued to receive care at the reporting date. 17\% (3001/18 183) required admission to high dependency or intensive care units; of these, 28\% (826/3001) were discharged alive, 32\% (958/3001) died, and 41\% (1217/3001) continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 17\% (276/1658) were discharged alive, 37\% (618/1658) died, and 46\% (764/1658) remained in hospital. Increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities including chronic cardiac disease, non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease and obesity were associated with higher mortality in hospital. Conclusions ISARIC WHO CCP-UK is a large prospective cohort study of patients in hospital with covid-19. The study continues to enrol at the time of this report. In study participants, mortality was high, independent risk factors were increasing age, male sex, and chronic comorbidity, including obesity. This study has shown the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks. Study registration ISRCTN66726260.},

 abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}COVID-19 is a multisystem disease and patients who survive might have in-hospital complications. These complications are likely to have important short-term and long-term consequences for patients, health-care utilisation, health-care system preparedness, and society amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim was to characterise the extent and effect of COVID-19 complications, particularly in those who survive, using the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We did a prospective, multicentre cohort study in 302 UK health-care facilities. Adult patients aged 19 years or older, with confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 were included in the study. The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of in-hospital complications, defined as organ-specific diagnoses occurring alone or in addition to any hallmarks of COVID-19 illness. We used multilevel logistic regression and survival models to explore associations between these outcomes and in-hospital complications, age, and pre-existing comorbidities.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Between Jan 17 and Aug 4, 2020, 80 388 patients were included in the study. Of the patients admitted to hospital for management of COVID-19, 49{$\cdot$}7\% (36 367 of 73 197) had at least one complication. The mean age of our cohort was 71{$\cdot$}1 years (SD 18{$\cdot$}7), with 56{$\cdot$}0\% (41 025 of 73 197) being male and 81{$\cdot$}0\% (59 289 of 73 197) having at least one comorbidity. Males and those aged older than 60 years were most likely to have a complication (aged {$\geq$}60 years: 54{$\cdot$}5\% [16 579 of 30 416] in males and 48{$\cdot$}2\% [11 707 of 24 288] in females; aged {$<$}60 years: 48{$\cdot$}8\% [5179 of 10 609] in males and 36{$\cdot$}6\% [2814 of 7689] in females). Renal (24{$\cdot$}3\%, 17 752 of 73 197), complex respiratory (18{$\cdot$}4\%, 13 486 of 73 197), and systemic (16{$\cdot$}3\%, 11 895 of 73 197) complications were the most frequent. Cardiovascular (12{$\cdot$}3\%, 8973 of 73 197), neurological (4{$\cdot$}3\%, 3115 of 73 197), and gastrointestinal or liver (0{$\cdot$}8\%, 7901 of 73 197) complications were also reported.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Complications and worse functional outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are high, even in young, previously healthy individuals. Acute complications are associated with reduced ability to self-care at discharge, with neurological complications being associated with the worst functional outcomes. COVID-19 complications are likely to cause a substantial strain on health and social care in the coming years. These data will help in the design and provision of services aimed at the post-hospitalisation care of patients with COVID-19.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}National Institute for Health Research and the UK Medical Research Council.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Multivariable logistic regression was performed for patient-perceived recovery with age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, and severity of acute illness as co-variates. Cluster analysis was performed using outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognition and physical function.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We report findings of 1077 patients discharged in 2020, from the assessment undertaken a median 5 [IQR4 to 6] months later: 36\% female, mean age 58 [SD 13] years, 69\% white ethnicity, 27\% mechanical ventilation, and 50\% had at least two co-morbidities. At follow-up only 29\% felt fully recovered, 20\% had a new disability, and 19\% experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with failure to recover were female, middle-age, white ethnicity, two or more co-morbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial and weakly related to acute severity. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment: 1) Very severe (17\%), 2) Severe (21\%), 3) Moderate with cognitive impairment (17\%), 4) Mild (46\%), with 3\%, 7\%, 36\% and 43\% feeling fully recovered, respectively. Persistent systemic inflammation determined by C-reactive protein was related to cluster severity, but not acute illness severity.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We identified factors related to recovery from a hospital admission with COVID-19 and four different phenotypes relating to the severity of physical, mental, and cognitive health five months later. The implications for clinical care include the potential to stratify care and the need for a pro-active approach with wide-access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Funding: UKRI and NIHR{$<$}/p{$>$}},

 abstract = {While it is now widely accepted that host inflammatory responses contribute to lung injury, the pathways that drive severity and distinguish coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from other viral lung diseases remain poorly characterized. We analyzed plasma samples from 471 hospitalized patients recruited through the prospective multicenter ISARIC4C study and 39 outpatients with mild disease, enabling extensive characterization of responses across a full spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Progressive elevation of levels of numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (including IL-6, CXCL10, and GM-CSF) were associated with severity and accompanied by elevated markers of endothelial injury and thrombosis. Principal component and network analyses demonstrated central roles for IL-6 and GM-CSF in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Comparing these profiles to archived samples from patients with fatal influenza, IL-6 was equally elevated in both conditions whereas GM-CSF was prominent only in COVID-19. These findings further identify the key inflammatory, thrombotic, and vascular factors that characterize and distinguish severe and fatal COVID-19. GM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19, but not severe influenza. GM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19, but not severe influenza.},
