<p>The outbreak analysis platform was developed by ISARIC4C to <em>encourgage and facilitate research</em> by collating, linking and presenting data together with high-performance computational capacity.</p>
<p>It provides a clinical and research data integration platform to facilitate integrative analyses of multi-omic, serial disease profiling, stratified by viral variant, clinical phenotype and outcome. The platform is hosted on nationally-leading, exabyte-scale computational infrastructure including state-of-the-art security systems for protection of identifiable data, and high-performance CPU/GPU computing (EPCC, and ARCHER/ARCHER2).</p>

<p>This platform now serves as a hub for a coordinated UK national research response to COVID-19. Data are included from:</p>
<ul>
<li>ISARIC4C tier 0: (unconsented) prospective clinical data from 204477 cases</li>
<li>ISARIC4C tiers 1 and 2: serial multiomic assays from research samples of blood, respiratory secretions, urine, and stool from 2306 cases</li>
<li>COG-UK: (unconsented) summary variant data from COG-UK viral sequencing study is already included for matched patients</li>
<li><a href="https://genomicc.org/uk">GenOMICC study</a> complete data: microarray and whole genome sequence data from 12454 cases</li>
<li>PHOSP complete data: follow-up clinical and biological data generated by the Post-Hospitalisation for COVID-19 follow-up study (1075 cases)</li>
<li>UK-CIC: deep immunological phenotyping data from across the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium, using ISARIC4C samples and local collections.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linkage-to-clinical-data">Linkage to clinical data</h2>
<p>Research data within the analysis platform is already linked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>NHS Scotland primary, secondary care and death records</li>
<li>NHS Digital health records data</li>
</ul>
<p>In future, plans are in place to transfer data to link with:</p>
<ul>
<li>ICNARC and SICSAG critical care audit databases</li>
<li>NIMS National Immunisation Dataset</li>
<li>Pillar 1 testing</li>
<li>Pillar 2 testing</li>
<li>ONS</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://isaric4c.net">ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (4C)</a> is the largest observational study of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 anyhwere in the world. By generating, integrating and analysing clinical, biological, genetic and virological data on patients with Covid-19 in UK hospitals (<span class="citation" data-cites="fig:map">@fig:map</span>), ISARIC4C has provided essential weekly updates to SAGE that guide the public health response, and enabled understanding of the clinical features,<span class="citation" data-cites="dochertyFeatures201332020">[@dochertyFeatures201332020]</span> prognostication,<span class="citation" data-cites="KnightRiskstratificationpatients2020">[@KnightRiskstratificationpatients2020]</span> disease biology<span class="citation" data-cites="thwaitesElevatedAntiviralMyeloid2020">[@thwaitesElevatedAntiviralMyeloid2020]</span> and host genetics.<span class="citation" data-cites="PairoCastineiraGeneticmechanismscritical2020">[@PairoCastineiraGeneticmechanismscritical2020]</span></p>
<h2 id="analysis-platform-structure">Analysis platform structure</h2>
<p>There are two routes of access to the analysis platform (<span class="citation" data-cites="fig:structure">@fig:structure</span>): 1. NHS Trusted Research Environment (Safe Haven) for access to personal clinical data and data collected without explicit consent. 2. Rapid-access flexible compute for access to non-disclosive research data collected with explicit consent.</p>
<p>Within both of these environments there is an additional division in the data: 1. Publishable “open access” data which any user can use and report as they wish, according to data protection and privacy rules; 2. Embargoed active research data, shared by academic investigators and available for linked analysis but not for publication without agreement from all contributors.</p>
<p>This design is intended to build trust in order to encourage immediate contributions of research data from academic collaborators.</p>

<h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>
<p>Rapid addition of viral sequence data from the COG-UK platform will enable real-time detection of the clinical impact of new viral strains, in-depth biological study of reinfection, and host:pathogen interactions at a genetic and mechanistic level.</p>
