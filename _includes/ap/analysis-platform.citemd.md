## Data held

The outbreak analysis platform was developed by ISARIC4C to *encourgage and facilitate research* by collating, linking and presenting data together with high-performance computational capacity. 

It provides a clinical and research data integration platform to facilitate integrative analyses of multi-omic, serial disease profiling, stratified by viral variant, clinical phenotype and outcome. The platform is hosted on nationally-leading, exabyte-scale computational infrastructure including state-of-the-art security systems for protection of identifiable data, and high-performance CPU/GPU computing (EPCC, and ARCHER/ARCHER2).

This platform now serves as a hub for a coordinated UK national research response to COVID-19. Data are included from:

- ISARIC4C tier 0: (unconsented) prospective clinical data from 204477 cases
- ISARIC4C tiers 1 and 2: serial multiomic assays from research samples of blood, respiratory secretions, urine, and stool from 2306 cases
- COG-UK: (unconsented) summary variant data from COG-UK viral sequencing study is already included for matched patients
- [GenOMICC study](https://genomicc.org/uk) complete data: microarray and whole genome sequence data from 12454 cases
- PHOSP complete data: follow-up clinical and biological data generated by the Post-Hospitalisation for COVID-19 follow-up study (1075 cases)
- UK-CIC: deep immunological phenotyping data from across the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium, using ISARIC4C samples and local collections.

## Linkage to clinical data

Research data within the analysis platform is already linked to:

- NHS Scotland primary, secondary care and death records
- NHS Digital health records data

In future, plans are in place to transfer data to link with:

- ICNARC and SICSAG critical care audit databases
- NIMS National Immunisation Dataset
- Pillar 1 testing
- Pillar 2 testing
- ONS

## Research outputs

The [ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (4C)](https://isaric4c.net) is the largest observational study of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 anyhwere in the world. By generating, integrating and analysing clinical, biological, genetic and virological data on patients with Covid-19 in UK hospitals (@fig:map), ISARIC4C has provided essential weekly updates to SAGE that guide the public health response, and enabled understanding of the clinical features,[@dochertyFeatures201332020] prognostication,[@KnightRiskstratificationpatients2020] disease biology[@thwaitesElevatedAntiviralMyeloid2020] and host genetics.[@PairoCastineiraGeneticmechanismscritical2020]

## Analysis platform structure

There are two routes of access to the analysis platform (@fig:structure):
1. NHS Trusted Research Environment (Safe Haven) for access to personal clinical data and data collected without explicit consent.
2. Rapid-access flexible compute for access to non-disclosive research data collected with explicit consent.

Within both of these environments there is an additional division in the data:
1. Publishable "open access" data which any user can use and report as they wish, according to data protection and privacy rules;
2. Embargoed active research data, shared by academic investigators and available for linked analysis but not for publication without agreement from all contributors.

This design is intended to build trust in order to encourage immediate contributions of research data from academic collaborators.

## Future plans

Rapid addition of viral sequence data from the COG-UK platform will enable real-time detection of the clinical impact of new viral strains, in-depth biological study of reinfection, and host:pathogen interactions at a genetic and mechanistic level.
