<p>We are a UK-wide consortium of doctors and scientists committed to answering urgent questions about COVID-19 quickly, openly, and for the benefit of all.</p>

<ul>
  <li>how long are people infectious, and what body fluids are infectious?</li>
  <li>what puts people at higher risk of severe illness?</li>
  <li>what is the best way to diagnose the disease?</li>
  <li>who should we treat early with drugs, and which drugs cause harm?</li>
  <li>does the immune system in some patients do more harm than good?</li>
  <li>what other infections(such as pneumonia or flu) happen at the same time?</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the last 8 years we have been preparing for such a major outbreak worldwide <a href="https://isaric.net/ccp">International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium Clinical Characterisation Protocol</a>; our team deployed immediately and has been collecting data and samples since the first cases were reported in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>

<p>ISARIC 4C is funded by a grant from UKRI (MRC) with a total value of Â£5.9M to JK Baillie (PI), University of Edinburgh; MG Semple, University of Liverpool; and P Openshaw, Imperial College London (co-leads). Full list of <a href="about/structure">investigators and specific deliverables</a>.</p>

<p>We share samples to get answers as fast as possible. We will not end this outbreak sitting on a biobank; our intention is to use every drop of every sample, now, to have the biggest possible impact on the COVID-19 crisis. Any investigators with the ability to contribute can <a href="sample_access">access our data and samples</a>. The ISARIC-4C study provides a foundation for other studies, such as clinical trials of new treatments, to help better understand the best way to use interventions.</p>
