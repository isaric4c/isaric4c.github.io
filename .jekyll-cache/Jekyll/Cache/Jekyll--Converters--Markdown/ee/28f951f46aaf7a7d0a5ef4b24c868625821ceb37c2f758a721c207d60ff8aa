<p>The <strong>ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium</strong> is a UK-wide consortium of leading experts in outbreak medicine with
a proficient, coordinated, and agile research response to COVID-19.</p>

<p>In 2019 a new virus, SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) emerged. It seems highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease COVID-19 will cause mortality unprecedented in modern times.</p>

<p>This is a new disease. There is a high chance that clinical trials will fail to detect therapeutic effects, by enrolling at the wrong time, or missing key subgroups or endpoints. Concurrent biological phenotyping can mitigate these risks, providing rapid, efficient clinical evidence.</p>

<p>Our response has been planned and tested over the past 8 years within the International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium (ISARIC).</p>
