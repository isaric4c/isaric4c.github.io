      <p><strong>CO</strong>VID19 <strong>C</strong>linical <strong>I</strong>nformation <strong>N</strong>etwork (DHSC-funded). Near real-time analysis and reporting of the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to inform the research and public health responses. To achieve this we need clincal research nurses and administrators to gather data from clinical notes and enter it into a simple online database.</p>

Either one sample set at recruitment, or 4 sample sets on Day 1, 3, and 9 and (if possible) another set 28 days after discharge. Aims to understand transmission, pathogenesis, and prognosis. To achieve this we need PPE-trained research nurses to obtain consent, and samples of pathogen shedding sites and blood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Adaptive platform drug trial, consent needed</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>R</strong>andomised <strong>E</strong>valuation of <strong>COV</strong>ID-19 Th<strong>er</strong>ap<strong>y</strong> (MRC/DHSC-funded). Trial of widely available, high-priority interventions, among confirmed COVID19 cases requiring hospital admission, to determine effect on death or requirement for invasive ventilation. Interventions will be added and removed over time as needed. Given the unprecedented impact COVID 19 will have on the health of the population, even small clinical benefits may be of significant benefit. Designed to give individual patients the best chance of getting an effective therapy. To do this we need GCP-trained research nurses to support front-line clinical staff recruiting patients.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Adaptive platform trial of supportive care interventions, consent waived</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>RECOVERY-RS is a multi-centre, pragmatic clinical trial evaluating the use of CPAP and / or high flow nasal oxygenation to prevent intubation and reduce mortality.  Uncertainty about the effectiveness of CPAP / HFNO in COVID-19 have led to conflicting guidance on the use of these interventions. Recruits patients with acute respiratory impairment (FiO2 &gt;0.4 and SpO2 &lt; 94%). Sites may choose to enrol in one or both arms of the trial (CPAP versus standard care, HFNO versus standard care or CPAP versus HFNO versus standard care). Sites are encouraged to contact the co-ordinating centre at RECOVERY-RS@warwick.ac.uk to log their interest in participation.</p>

UK-wide ICU study to identify variants underlying genetic susceptibility to critical illness with coronavirus, which may help identify new targets for treatment and mechanisms of disease. This study was funded in 2014 and was recruiting across the UK before the pandemic hit.</p>
