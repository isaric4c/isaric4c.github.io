## Who decides on the use of finite resources?

All data and samples collected in the ISARIC 4C study are controlled by an independent data and materials access committee (IDAMAC), composed of representatives of research funders, academia, clincal medicine, public health and industry. Their job is to ensure that all samples are used to generate the greatest possible benefit to humanity, in the shortest possible time.

If you are interested in requesting samples please *briefly* answer the questions below and send to isaric4c-samples@roslin.ed.ac.uk, including this statment in your email:
