# Work with us

There has never been a more exciting time to join our dynamic and driven data team in designing, developing, and delivering the Outbreak Data Analysis Platform (ODAP).  

We are curating and driving research activities using COVID-19 data from various studies and institutions across the UK - including from the ISARIC4C; PHOSP-COVID and GenOMICC studies [Analysis Platform](https://isaric4c.net/analysis-platform/).

We have an exciting and diverse range of opportunities covering all areas, for talented individuals at all levels. 

* To ensure maximum impact, we are looking for an enthusiastic [communications manager](https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/2722/?utm_medium=jobshare) to design and lead a creative and high-quality communication strategy to raise awareness of the ODAP. 

* We are also looking for experienced and skilled [data analysts](https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/2438/?utm_medium=jobshare) and [data curation administrators](https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/2437/?utm_medium=jobshare) to deliver a product of not just world-class research, but with exceptional curation and linkage capabilities. 

* As easily accessible data is core to our operating ethos, we are now also looking for a dedicated and inspiring [data access manager](https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/2433/?utm_medium=jobshare) who will be supported by a team of [data access administrators](https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/2437/?utm_medium=jobshare) to oversee and deliver a high level of service in access to this valuable resource and its outputs. 

We are always interested to hear from experienced and enthusiastic individuals, so please get in touch with our [study team](mailto:isaric4c-samples@roslin.ed.ac.uk) for more information.
