# Work with us

There has never been a more exciting time to join our dynamic and driven data team in designing, developing, and delivering the ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Protocol and the 
[Outbreak Data Analysis Platform](https://isaric4c.net/analysis-platform/) (ODAP).  

We are curating and driving research activities using COVID-19 data from various studies and institutions across the UK - including from the ISARIC4C; PHOSP-COVID and GenOMICC studies.

We are always interested to hear from experienced and enthusiastic individuals, so please get in touch with our [study team](mailto:isaric4c-samples@roslin.ed.ac.uk) for more information. 

See [previous outputs from ISARIC 4C](/outputs/)
