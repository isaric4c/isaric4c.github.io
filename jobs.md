# Work with us

## Data analyst (3 positions)

The ISARIC 4C, PHOSP and CIC consortia are working together to build and maintain a world-leading, accessible [data analysis platform](/analysis-platform) to deeply characterise COVID-19 including clinical data from 80,000 patients, genetic data from 15000 patients, and deep biological data from 2000.

We are putting together a data management and architecture team to curate, link and analyse this dataset, providing key insights into COVID-19 and facilitating access and analysis by highly-skilled research groups across the UK and the world.
