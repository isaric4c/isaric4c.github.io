# Work with us

There has never been a more exciting time to join our dynamic and driven data team in designing, developing, and delivering the ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Protocol and the

We are curating and driving research activities using COVID-19 data from various studies and institutions across the UK - including from the ISARIC4C; PHOSP-COVID and GenOMICC studies.

We are always interested to hear from experienced and enthusiastic individuals, so please get in touch with our [study team](mailto:isaric4c-samples@roslin.ed.ac.uk) for more information.
