# The ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (4C) study

This page is intended to provide updates for participants on the work that has been done with their samples and data. We will keep this page updated with research results, reports and plans.

# Governance

All data and samples collected in the ISARIC 4C study are controlled by an independent data and materials access committee (IDAMAC), composed of representatives of research funders, academia, clincal medicine, public health and industry. Their job is to ensure that all samples are used to generate the greatest possible benefit to humanity, in the shortest possible time.

# Funding and Support

We have interim funding for this study from the UK MRC.

We are grateful for the support of many UK organsations and professional bodies, including the Intensive Care Society (ICS).
