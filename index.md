# ISARIC4C (Comprehensive Clinical Characterisation Collaboration)

We are an open, inclusive UK-wide collaboration of doctors and scientists committed to answering urgent questions about emerging infections and public health threats quickly, openly, and for the benefit of all. 

Since 2012 we have been preparing for outbreaks worldwide.

## Recruitment

ISARIC4C is currently actively recruiting cases in the UK with:

	- unexplained acute hepatitis
	- monkeypox

## Analysis Platform

The ISARIC4C study has created an open-access [integrated analysis platform](analysis-platform) for linked clincal data from across the NHS for a range of studies, including ISARIC4C, GenOMICC, PHOSP, COG-UK and UK-CIC.

## Funding

ISARIC4C is funded by UK Research and Inovation (UKRI) and The National Institute For Health Research (NIHR). We share data and samples to get answers as fast as possible. Any investigators with the ability to contribute can [access our data and samples](sample_access). The ISARIC4C study provides a foundation for other studies, such as clinical trials of new treatments, to help better understand the best way to use interventions.
