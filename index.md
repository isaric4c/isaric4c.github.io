# ISARIC4C (Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium)

We are a UK-wide consortium of doctors and scientists committed to answering urgent questions about COVID-19 quickly, openly, and for the benefit of all. Over the last 9 years we have been preparing for such a major outbreak worldwide [International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium Clinical Characterisation Protocol](https://isaric.net/ccp); our team deployed immediately and has been collecting data and samples since the first cases were reported in the UK.

## Recruitment

<span id="date">We</span> have recruited:
- <span id="num-tier-0">{% include numbers/crf_count.txt %}</span> patients at Tier Zero case report forms(CO-CIN)
- <span id="num-tier-2">{% include numbers/multiomics_count.txt %}</span> patients at Tier 1/2 (host/viral multiomics)
- <span id="num-tier-0">{% include numbers/genomicc_count.txt %}</span> critically-ill patients can also be recruited to a sister study, the [ISARIC GenOMICC study](https://genomicc.org) 

## Analysis Platform

The ISARIC4C study has created an open-access [integrated analysis platform](/analysis-platform) for linked clincal data from across the NHS for a range of studies, including ISARIC4C, GenOMICC, PHOSP, COG-UK and UK-CIC.

## Funding

ISARIC4C is funded by two major awards from UK Reasearch and Inovation (UKRI) and The National Institute For Health Research (NIHR).
A grant from UKRI Medical Research Council with a total value of £5.9M to JK Baillie (PI), University of Edinburgh; MG Semple, University of Liverpool; and P Openshaw, Imperial College London (co-leads). Full list of [investigators and specific deliverables](about/structure).
A grant from NIHR with a current value of £8.9M to MG Semple (CI), University of Liverpool; AD Docherty, University of Edinburgh, and CA Green, University of Birmingham.
We share data and samples to get answers as fast as possible. We will not end this outbreak sitting on a biobank; our intention is to use every drop of every sample, now, to have the biggest possible impact on the COVID-19 crisis. Any investigators with the ability to contribute can [access our data and samples](sample_access). The ISARIC4C study provides a foundation for other studies, such as clinical trials of new treatments, to help better understand the best way to use interventions.
